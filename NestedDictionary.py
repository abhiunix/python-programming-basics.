#Compound Data Structures
#We can include containers in other containers to create compound data structures. 
#For example, this dictionary maps keys to values that are also dictionaries!

#We can access elements in this nested dictionary like this.
helium = elements["helium"]  # to get the helium dictionary

#You can also add a new key to the element dictionary.
